Space shooter is a game where a player controls a spaceship and ``fires lasers`` at oncoming enemy spaceships at the top of the screen. The player is able to move their spaceship ``up, down, left and right`` to both target enemy spaceships, as well as avoid incoming lasers from the enemy ships. The objective is to clear all the ships to progress onto the next level. ``Red spaceships`` are the ``largest`` and they move the ``slowest``, ``green`` ones move ``moderately fast`` while ``blue ships`` are the ``smallest`` move the ``quickest``. If the player's spaceship comes into contact with a laser from an enemy ship, or the enemy ship itself, then ``health points`` are deducted. A player gets 2 points for every enemy ship they hit and their final score is outputted at the end. Additionally, the game includes sound effects when a player fires a laser and when an enemy ship is hit. If the player runs out of health, the ``game ends``.
